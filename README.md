**ROS**

ROS nodes using this code (tested in the TurtleBot) are provided in a separate repo:

## DISCLAIMER and IMPORTANT NOTES

- The code is not deeply tested. I've just tested it works for the cases I need. If you find any problem, have any question (or whatever), please write to: javvgomez _at_ gmail.com

- The compilation time is highly increased due to CImg library. Please, omit it when possible.

- License GNU/GPL V3: http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html

- This is a source code intended for my research. Although I want it to be useful for other people it is not intended to act as a library (there are many many points to improve). However, if you show interest or have feature request do not hesitate to contact me and I will try my best to improve the code for whoever needs it. I am also open to contributions and to create a formal library if necessary.


## Documentation

- [API Reference](jvgomez.github.io/fastmarching/)
- This README is important as well.


To build latest the documentation:

    $ cd doc
    $ doxygen

Go into the HTML folder and open index.html


## Dependencies:

This code uses C\++11 so a compiler g++ 4.8 or equivalent is required. With GCC 4.7 some runtime problems can occur.

Additional dependencies:

    sudo apt-get install imagemagick libboost-all-dev
    sudo apt-get install 

The code provides a copy of the CImg library. This will take care of loading and savig images. Depending on the extension used, you will need to install another libraries as said in the main page of CImg: http://cimg.sourceforge.net/

## Building the code
To build the code:

    $ cd build
    $ cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release (Release, RelWithDebInf or Debug, Release by default)
    $ make -j8 (or the number of cores you want to use during compilation)
    $ sudo make install (only if you want to install the library)
    $ ./fmm -map1 ../data/testimg.png -map2 ../data/map.png -vel ../data/velocities.png

This main shows most of the utilities implemented so far.

## Folder structure

Although there are a lot of folders, they are quite simple. It is organized this way because I'm focusing on an upload to Biicode (www.biicode.com)

+ build: where the code should be compiled.
+ console: the console class.
+ data: additional files and maps to test.
  + alpha: contains code the be refactorized and included in the library in the future.
+ doc: doxygen documentation.
+ examples: easy examples to understand how to use the code.
+ fm2: Fast Marching Square (FM2) algorithms.
+ fmm: Fast Marching Algorithms.
  + fmdata: classes related to the data types of the Fast Marching Method and other algorithms.
+ gradientdescent: under development.
+ io: input/output helper classes.
+ ndgridmap: main container.
+ scripts: matlab scripts to parse outputs and automatic benchmarking bash script.
+ thirdparty: others' software included.

## KNOWN ISSUES

- Gradient Descent for FM2* could fail if very narrow passages are in the way of the path.
- It seems that UFMM can fail in maps with random (or similar) velocity changes.

## TODO

At the top of each file there are specific TODO comments. Here are some others:

- Mix SFMM and UFMM (researchy TODO).
- MapLoader, GridWriter... get a naming convention. MapReader or GridSaver for instance.
- Improve untidy queue implementation with hash maps (specially remove element in increase_priority()).
- Upload as a unique biicode block.
- printRunInfo implementation missing for most of the solvers.
- Unify GridWriter and GridPlotter functions parameter order: (grid, name)
- Review and update nDGridMap.pdf
- Fix Doxygen warnings.
- Convert all scripts to python (or similar) so that they keep completely open source.
- Improve the way FM2 and its versions deal with the grid when running multiple times on the same grid. Concretely, avoid recomputation of velocities map.
- Reimplement FM2Dir from scratch. Currently in data/alpha folder.
- Restructure the folder and the CMake files in order to properly have examples and that stuff.
- Substitute arg parsing with boost_options.
- Remove relative file dependencies (#include "../../fmm", filename = "../../data", CMakeLists.txt deps, etc).
- Implement a grid copy constructor and assignment operator, etc.
- Most of the unsigned int should be replaced by size_t to be type-correct.
- Use smart pointers (specially for grid).
- Create a testing framework.
- BenchmarkCFG::configure, parse ctorParams_ with a variadic templated function, something like:` parseParams<int, bool>(param1, param2)`, `parseParams<string,double,bool>(p1,p2,p3)`.
- For most methods, neighbors for same cell are computed many times. Store them like FMT to save some computation time.
- GridPlotter code can be refactorized so that the same code is not repeated many times.
- Review template template parameters, perhaps it can be simplified (specially for benchmark): `template <grid_t>` to `template <nDGridMap <cell_t, ndims>>` so we can use cell_t without doing `template <grid_t, cell_t>` (redundant).
